# CSE-512 Project: Analysis of Geospatial Operations on Distributed Data Platform
Applying spatial statistics to spatio-temporal big data in order to identify statistically significant spatial hot spots using Apache Spark and Scala.
Load GeoSpark jar into Apache Spark Scala shell

## PHASE 1:
Write two User Defined Functions ST_Contains and ST_Within in SparkSQL and use them to do four spatial queries:

1. Range query: Use ST_Contains. Given a query rectangle R and a set of points P, find all the points within R.

2. Range join query: Use ST_Contains. Given a set of Rectangles R and a set of Points S, find all (Point, Rectangle) pairs        such that the point is within the rectangle.

3. Distance query: Use ST_Within. Given a point location P and distance D in km, find all points that lie within a distance D    from P

4. Distance join query: Use ST_Within. Given a set of Points S1 and a set of Points S2 and a distance D in km, find all (s1,      s2) pairs such that s1 is within a distance D from s2 (i.e., s1 belongs to S1 and s2 belongs to S2).

##PHASE 2:
In this phase, we will do spatial hot spot analysis including two tasks


### Hot zone analysis
This task will needs to perform a range join operation on a rectangle datasets and a point dataset. For each rectangle, the number of points located within the rectangle will be obtained. The hotter rectangle means that it include more points. So this task is to calculate the hotness of all the rectangles. 

### Hot cell analysis

#### Description
This task will focus on applying spatial statistics to spatio-temporal big data in order to identify statistically significant spatial hot spots using Apache Spark. The topic of this task is from ACM SIGSPATIAL GISCUP 2016.

The Problem Definition page is here: [http://sigspatial2016.sigspatial.org/giscup2016/problem](http://sigspatial2016.sigspatial.org/giscup2016/problem) 

The Submit Format page is here: [http://sigspatial2016.sigspatial.org/giscup2016/submit](http://sigspatial2016.sigspatial.org/giscup2016/submit)

#### Special requirement (different from GIS CUP)
As stated in the Problem Definition page, in this task, you are asked to implement a Spark program to calculate the Getis-Ord statistic of NYC Taxi Trip datasets. We call it "**Hot cell analysis**"

To reduce the computation power needï¼Œwe made the following changes:

1. The input will be a monthly taxi trip dataset from 2009 - 2012. For example, "yellow\_tripdata\_2009-01\_point.csv", "yellow\_tripdata\_2010-02\_point.csv".
2. Each cell unit size is 0.01 * 0.01 in terms of latitude and longitude degrees.
3. You should use 1 day as the Time Step size. The first day of a month is step 1. Every month has 31 days.
4. You only need to consider Pick-up Location.
5. We don't use Jaccard similarity to check your answer.
However, you don't need to worry about how to decide the cell coordinates because the code template generated cell coordinates. You just need to write the rest of the task.

## Coding template specification

### Input parameters

1. Output path (Mandatory)
2. Task name: "hotzoneanalysis" or "hotcellanalysis"
3. Task parameters: (1) Hot zone (2 parameters): nyc taxi data path, zone path(2) Hot cell (1 parameter): nyc taxi data path

Example
```
test/output hotzoneanalysis src/resources/point-hotzone.csv src/resources/zone-hotzone.csv hotcellanalysis src/resources/yellow_trip_sample_100000.csv
```

Note: 

1. The number/order of tasks do not matter.
2. But, the first 7 of our final test cases will be hot zone analysis, the last 8 will be hot cell analysis.




### Input data format
The main function/entrace is "cse512.Entrance" scala file.

1. Point data: the input point dataset is the pickup point of New York Taxi trip datasets. The data format of this phase is the original format of NYC taxi trip which is different from the previous phase. But the coding template already parsed it for you. Find the data from our asu google drive shared folder: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W4GLKNsGlgXp7fHtDlhHEBdLVw_IuAXh?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W4GLKNsGlgXp7fHtDlhHEBdLVw_IuAXh?usp=sharing). To get the permission to download the data, you have to use your asu gmail account.

2. Zone data (only for hot zone analysis): at "src/resources/zone-hotzone" of the template

#### Hot zone analysis
The input point data can be any small subset of NYC taxi dataset.

#### Hot cell analysis
The input point data is a monthly NYC taxi trip dataset (2009-2012) like "yellow\_tripdata\_2009-01\_point.csv"

### Output data format

#### Hot zone analysis
All zones with their count, sorted by "rectangle" string in an ascending order. 

```
"-73.795658,40.743334,-73.753772,40.779114",1
"-73.797297,40.738291,-73.775740,40.770411",1
"-73.832707,40.620010,-73.746541,40.665414",20
```


#### Hot cell analysis
The coordinates of top 50 hotest cells sorted by their G score in a descending order. Note, DO NOT OUTPUT G score.

```
-7399,4075,15
-7399,4075,29
-7399,4075,22
```
### Example answers
An example input and answer are put in "testcase" folder of the coding template. 

1. hotcell-example-answer-withZscore-sample.csv -- answer of the sampled input data with score.
2. hotcell-example-answer-withZscore.csv -- answer with score of the full input data from Google Drive shared folder.
3. hotcell-example-answer.csv -- the expected output result of using the yellow_tripdata_2009-01_point.csv as the input.
4. hotcell-example-input.txt -- the input for running the jar file.


### How to run submit code to Spark
If you are using the Scala template

1. Go to project root folder
2. Run ```sbt clean assembly```. You may need to install sbt in order to run this command.
3. Find the packaged jar in "./target/scala-2.11/CSE512-Project-Hotspot-Analysis-Template-assembly-0.1.0.jar"
4. Submit the jar to Spark using Spark command "./bin/spark-submit". A pseudo code example: ```./bin/spark-submit ~/GitHub/CSE512-Project-Hotspot-Analysis-Template/target/scala-2.11/CSE512-Project-Hotspot-Analysis-Template-assembly-0.1.0.jar test/output hotzoneanalysis src/resources/point-hotzone.csv src/resources/zone-hotzone.csv hotcellanalysis src/resources/yellow_tripdata_2009-01_point.csv```
